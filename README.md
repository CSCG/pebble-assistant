# pebble-assistant
Genericized source code for a voice-activated personal assistant app for Pebble Time series smartwatches.


## How to use
You'll need to modify the parse and ask functions in `src/app.js`, and put resources in the `resources` folder if you want to.

If you use the source code to make an awesome Pebble app, a shoutout in your app's config would be cool. (And send a link to @technoboyIO on Twitter! :)


(Also, please don't replicate the original Wolfram Alpha functionality - I'd like to maybe come back to that idea someday)
